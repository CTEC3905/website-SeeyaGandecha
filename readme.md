For this assignment I used a combination of the examples given in Labs and https://www.w3schools.com to create the final submission displaying the use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Throughout the website I have used external links such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.

For the "About" page of my website I used an Instagram widget from: https://instawidget.net but then changed it and created a new one from: https://www.grahamsnaps.com as this was more responsive to the page size and I was able to gain more control over this from the generator on the site.

The main issue I had come across during the creation of this website was image population. I tried many different methods taken from StackOverflow such as; https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18480550/how-to-load-all-the-images-from-one-of-my-folder-into-my-web-page-using-jquery and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34259048/calling-img-src-tag-in-loop and so many more of course! 
It took 3 days of working on the issue, but I finally managed to solve the issue using: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42816718/javascript-using-loop-to-fill-array-with-urls-for-images

However, my JavaScript ended up being very 'wet' and with many failed attempted at trying to turn this into 'dry' code I eventually moved on.
If you look at the ttt.js file you will be able to see repeated code. I left this as it works well and (although a lot) it is easier to distinguish between each as comments section between them.

For the albums I used https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp as a guide to create an customise my album covers. https://dev.to/hakash/100-pure-htmlcss-page-navigation---no-javascript-required-2em5 was used to help navigation and loading of images for each album and https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_grid_responsive.asp to create the responsive layout for images shown. The main portfolio page was the most difficult out to create as there were a lot of issues arising.

The cover page shown on the home screen when you first enter the site was created using LocalStorage. Once the user has viewed the site, the 'cover' will not show up again (unless browser data is erased). JavaScript code for this was taken from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30899415/show-a-div-only-once-per-time-the-user-is-on-the-site, If you look at the commits, you will see I struggled to get this work but then managed to compromise with this solution.

During the entire process of creating this site, I used Chrome to test the desktop view of the site but also used multiple android devices to check the responsive formatting.

Overall, I have enjoyed this module and creating my final submission, I have learned a lot and it's definitely given me an incite into web Development. Hope you enjoy the photography!
